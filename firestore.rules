/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Sorteum Digital.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, where only authenticated admins can manage raffles.
 * Public users can purchase tickets for raffles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores admin user profiles. Existence determines admin role.
 * - /admins/{adminId}/raffles/{raffleId}: Stores raffle data, managed by admins.
 * - /raffles/{raffleId}/tickets/{ticketId}: Stores tickets associated with raffles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Only authenticated admins can create, update, or delete raffles.
 * - Public users can purchase tickets for active raffles, but writes are limited.
 * - Listing raffles is only allowed by the admin.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Raffle documents include the `adminId` to denote ownership, avoiding `get()` calls in rules.
 * - Ticket documents include the `raffleId` to create a connection between the tickets and the raffles.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Admins and public user data are stored in separate collections to simplify security rules.
